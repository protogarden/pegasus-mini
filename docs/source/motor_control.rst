Controlling the Motors
######################

The Pegasus-Mini uses the BasicMicro Roboclaw 2x7A Motor Controller in order to control each of its drive motors, each having independant encoders. The motor controller uses these encoders inoder to provide information 
such as motor ticks aswell as motor speed in the form of ticks per a second. A tick can be desribed as change in angle of the motor. The Pegasus-Mini has 64 ticks per a rotation of its drive motors.
